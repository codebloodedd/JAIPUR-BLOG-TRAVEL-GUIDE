      <h2 class="ltext leftHead">Get to Know Jaipur</h2>
      <p class="ltext leftContent">India’s official ‘pink city’, there’s much more to Rajasthan’s capital than its pink-red-tinged buildings and historic splendour. This majestic home to erstwhile royals is complete with old-world charm surrounded by
        colorful markets and chaotic streets. A part of the ‘Golden Triangle, Jaipur is a must-visit destination along with Agra and New Delhi.</p>

      <h2 class="rtext rightHead">1. HAWA MAHAL</h2>
      <p class="rtext rightContent">Watch fascinatingly carved windows of the Palace of Winds, Hawa Mahal. Prefered time to visit is during sunset or sunrise. As it’s on a busy road it’s quite easy to miss as you whizz by in the traffic! When you get
        dropped off there is a little area to observe and take photos within the market street. Unless you want a really bad angled photo that is almost vertical, I would head across the street to observe it in the many cafés there.</p>

      <h2 class="ltext leftHead">2. CITY PALACE</h2>
      <p class="ltext leftContent">Located just behind the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s famous City Palace, the centerpiece of the city and the heart of founder Jai Singh II’s reign. The City Palace includes Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal as well as a number of other structures. Built with highly trained architectural care, City Palace combines Rajput, Mogul and European styles and is another stunning example of Jaipur’s royal influences. Concentric zones to fortify the inner dwellings of the palace, as well as the period-appropriate asymmetric design, make it an architectural marvel.</p>

      <h2 class="rtext rightHead">3. PATRIKA GATE</h2>
      <p class="rtext rightContent">The Patrika Gate is an entranceway to the Jahawar Circle Park which, if you didn’t know already, is the biggest circular park in Asia on a traffic signal! As you walk under the gate, you’ll find a row of fabulous archways. Each one has been decorated with Rajasthani culture in mind. It showcases major attractions in Jaipur, such as Jal Mahal, as well as colourful artwork. You’ll truly be mesmerised by the decoration and it will take you a while to stop admiring every detail. It’s easy to see why this is a top photo location in the city. It’s incredibly gorgeous. </p>

      <h2 class="ltext leftHead">4. AMBER FORT</h2>
      <p class="ltext leftContent">The Amer Fort sits around 15 kilometres away from the main city of Jaipur, so you’ll need to get a Tuk-Tuk, Tam-Tam, or Taxi here. I would recommend starting your day off here in the morning to beat the heat and the crowds! This fort is the most beautiful in Rajasthan and showcases some fantastic history of Maharajas of old and royal apartments. You can also get some awesome views of Jaipur and the Nahargarh Fort as it stands so high. A lot of people choose to ride the elephants up the hill to arrive in style, I would recommend that you don’t do it. </p>

      <h2 class="rtext rightHead">5. NAHARGARH FORT</h2>
      <p class="rtext rightContent">Overlooking the gorgeous Pink City of Jaipur lies a magnificent structure – Nahargarh Fort. Built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, encompassed a larger than life structure that would not only protect the city but also add to its charm and richness. You get a gorgeous view of Jaipur city. Preferably visit Nahargarh fort during sunset as sunset makes the view 10 times better.</p>

      <h2 class="ltext leftHead">6. GALTA JI TEMPLE</h2>
      <p class="ltext leftContent">This temple is also known as the monkey temple in Jaipur, but I got told off calling in that. But, most tourists know it like this due to the massive tribe of monkeys which have made the place their home! We hired a kid to take us up to the top. We bought some monkey nuts and he will teach you how to feed and touch them.</p>
